_Descriptive Statistics_

Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and organizing the data so they can be easily understood. Descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, seeks to describe the data, but do not attempt to make inferences from the sample to the whole population. Here, we typically describe the data in a sample. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of probability theory.

Descriptive statistics are broken down into two categories. Measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread).

_Measure of Central Tendency_

Central tendency refers to the idea that there is one number that best summarizes the entire set of measurements, a number that is in some way “central” to the set.

_Mean / Average_

Mean or Average is a central tendency of the data i.e. a number around which a whole data is spread out. In a way, it is a single number which can estimate the value of whole data set.

_Median_

Median is the value which divides the data in 2 equal parts i.e. number of terms on right side of it is same as number of terms on left side of it when data is arranged in either ascending or descending order.

_Measure of Spread / Dispersion_

Measure of Spread refers to the idea of variability within your data.

_Standard deviation_

Standard deviation is the measurement of average distance between each quantity and mean. That is, how data is spread out from mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean of the data set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

_Variance_

Variance is a square of average distance between each quantity and mean. That is it is square of standard deviation.
