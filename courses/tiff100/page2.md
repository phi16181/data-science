**What Can We Do With AI?**

Likely, the better question is what can’t we do with AI? It has already been used almost everywhere and this is likely one of the many reasons it is so often hard to define. Machine Learning has been responsible for most of the more recent developments and is only continuing to grow exponentially so this is where we’ll focus much of the remainder of the focus this course. Let’s dive a little deeper and look at different types of machine learning and examples of how they are used in the context of AI.

_Supervised Machine Learning_

Jason Brownlee (1) Defined Supervised Machine Learning as “the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset just as a teacher supervising the learning process.” This type of machine learning has often been compared to learning to ride a bike (2), except we use an algorithm or set of instructions we design for a machine or piece of software to do the ‘learning’ for us. Imagine if we had to learn to ride one million different types of bicycles just how hard translating what we learn from one experience to another would be. While it would seem difficult for us to do, an algorithm can do this type of correlation quite easily and very quickly.
