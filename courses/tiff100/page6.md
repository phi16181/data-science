**Lesson 2: Understanding the Problem:**

Student X, the most integral part of any Artificial Intelligence process is understanding the problem we are to solve before we get started designing any of the implementations of the solution. This is centred on obtaining as much knowledge as one can about the data whether through asking an expert and acquiring domain knowledge or, in its absence, using Statistical methods and tools to assist one in doing the same. In this lesson we’re going to visit a mock scenario we present to all of our apprentices. The goal of this exercise is for you and me to work together to identify potential aspects of a dataset that we might need to extract for a project and which aspects, if any, we can leave behind. This will help us better understand the nature of the business problem being asked while also learning some new tools that will assist us in making decisions.
