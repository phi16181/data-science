**Assignment 1:**

Since this is the first assignment of your apprenticeship let's take it slow and use this as a good time to review what we've learned so far.  I'm going to present to you a typical scenario we run into here at work and I would like you to decide which type of machine learning would work best to solve the problem in the scenario I am describing. It's important to not overthink it at this point but really just concentrate on how each type of machine learning functions.  I don't need you to dive into the math behind the scenes but more so think about super high-level functionality of each type of machine learning and be prepared to discuss why you think the type you chose is correct.

**Scenario:**

**Self-driving cars are hard!**

Much of the work we do here is centred on having cars making decisions on their own;  many of these decisions have to be different and more optimal than the drivers would have made on their own.  

In most cases, our algorithms are absorbing real-time data at a lightning pace and constantly making decisions that control all sorts of machinery and processes whether inside the cabin and outside of the car itself. Countless numbers of sensors inside and outside of the car and sometimes even data retrieved from external sources like Global Positioning Systems help us ultimately build vehicles that will someday hopefully be safer on the road. Most of our algorithms are making decisions on the Fly, so to speak. 

**_What type of machine learning do you think we use most?_**
