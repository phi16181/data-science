**Scenario:**

As an apprentice, you have been asked to study the following business problem and included data to ascertain the specific variables to keep and which to discard. The data and description are attached to this document. The business, Advanced IoT, is trying to ascertain if it might be viable for their team to set up a local solar installation sales team in the town of Watt, IA. 

In order to do so, they must better understand the daily household energy consumption for that same area. If household energy consumption varies more than 30% from day-to-day it might be beneficial for solar energy resources to help better distribute this usage. Here is a summary of the data variables we received from the power company (most households have submeters):


    1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
    2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
    3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
    4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
    5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
    6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
    7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas-powered). 
    8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
    It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 
    9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
    It corresponds to an electric water heater and an air-conditioner.

Did I mention the data was collected for every minute of each day? This might be too often, but you can decide that for your own analysis.
