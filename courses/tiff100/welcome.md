<img src="images/woamnIcon.png" align="left"><p> Welcome to <b>AutoMotion!</b> We’re the predominate Electric Vehicle (ECV) manufacturer in the industry and we are very excited to have you on board as an apprentice in our Artifical Intelligence (AI) program. My name is Brenda and I will be your mentor during your apprenticeship. I went through our same apprenticeship program and can honestly say it has been foundational to my success here as I have learned everything I needed to know by working on real projects through the course of my learning. You and I will be working together on many projects until you are ready to move to the next phase of the program. This will occur after you have mastered building your own data ingestion pipeline and use various visualization and transformation methods to build a proper dataset needed for an upcoming Machine Learning project, which we will discuss later. Let's get started!</p>

---
**Our Purpose:**

You and I have been tasked with designing a process that allows our AI engineers to use streaming data as a source for training and testing a new set of Machine Learning algorithms for our latest set of sensors our cars need for making decisions on the road to keep drivers safe. This concept of data ingestion is vital to any optimal AI process, but it is very involved and possibly a bit too deep for your skills right now, but we’ll get there together with time. To start our journey, lets first dive into some general AI and data-related concepts but do not worry, we’ll be doing much more work than lecturing so get ready to learn!
